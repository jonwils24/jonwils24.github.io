# Site service

A site is a collaborative area for a unit of work or a project.

The methods available for the Site service are grouped into `siteservice` and `site` object types.

The `siteservice` object provides methods to create sites, list sites in the repository, list roles that can be assigned to members of a site, and get sites for given names.
-   **[Site object](../references/API-JS-Site.md)**  
The `site` object provides various properties and methods.

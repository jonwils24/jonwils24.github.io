# Welcome

Welcome to Alfresco documentation. The goal of this documentation is to provide information on installing, configuring, using, administering, customizing, extending, and troubleshooting Alfresco.

If you are an Alfresco Enterprise customer you can find the Alfresco Support Handbooks [here](http://docs.alfresco.com/support/index.jsp).

The following notes explain how to get around the documentation.

## Navigating

Browse topics in the Contents frame \(![](../images/contents_view.gif)\) on the left. Click on a topic to have it displayed. Use the Back and Forward buttons to navigate within the history of viewed topics.

## Searching

To quickly locate topics on a particular subject in the documentation, enter a query in the Search field. Use the Search frame \(![](../images/search_results_view.gif)\) to display the Search view. You can narrow the scope of your search by selecting only the sections you are interested in.

**Note:** You can use the **Search topics** button to narrow the search scope to just this topic, or to this topic and its subtopics.

-   Click the **Search topics** button ![Search Topics icon](../topics/../images/e_quick_search_multi.gif) in the **Contents** toolbar.

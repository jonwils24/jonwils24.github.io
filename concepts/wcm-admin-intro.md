# Alternative Versioning Model \(AVM\)

This section describes the installation, configuration, and deployment procedures for the Alfresco WCM functionality using the Alternative Versioning Model \(AVM\).

-   **[About Alternative Versioning Model \(AVM\)](../concepts/WCM-intro-AVM.md)**  
The Alfresco repository currently supports two store implementations. The “core”, or Document Management based store used by the Quick Start, and the Alternative Versioning Model \(AVM\). The AVM is an alternative store implementation designed to support the version control requirements of managing websites and web applications. The AVM consists of a forest of content stores that can be used to manage the development and staging of web content and associated source code. Each AVM store is loosely modeled on Subversion, providing static content control for websites.

# Configuring AVM

This section describes how to configure AVM.

In AVM, content is managed in sandboxes, which isolate each user's changes, and content can be submitted to a shared \(staging\) sandbox, and then deployed either to a flat file system or another instance of Alfresco. Content is collected and displayed using forms, and workflow controls the approval and publishing of content.

WCM preview allows editorial users to preview the website in-context \(with the style, markup, and composition of the website\), but using the content from any sandbox in the system. Preview provides a way for contributors and reviewers to view changes as if they had been published to the live site, without publishing those changes.
